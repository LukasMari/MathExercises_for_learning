# MathExercises_Fun

In this repository I will be making the CodeTrain Challenges to better enhance my Mathemathical skills in programming and to understand how the two can work together. I will also try to find extra exercises other than those of Codetrain to further develop, and generally just post fun things to do here.
Later on when I understand my algorithms better I will be trying to incorporate my ML-exercices from the book, "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow" by Aurelion GÃ©ron. Before that some more human learning will be needed...

## Programming languages

1. Processing
2. Javascript with libraries
    1. P5.js
    2. Tenserflow.js
    3. ...
3. Python with ML libraries
4. C++ ( Later on for hopefully some visual .exe programs in the future)
5. ... What is fun I guess
